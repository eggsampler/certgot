# `certgot/parser`

---

This package holds some experiments from exploring (Parsing Expression Grammars)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar]

Will come back to this once we need to actually parse config files, like nginx and apache.

One of the problems I remember encountering was using the parsed tree to edit a config file in place.
